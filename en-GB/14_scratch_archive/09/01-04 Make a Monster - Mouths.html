<h2>Activity Checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>To make your monster talk, you can just use the <code class="blockpurple">Say</code> sprite.</p>
<p><img src="a6c527dcfcfd6660ee436f754fa49b24ec6c02da.png" alt="when [space v] key pressed
    say [Hello!] for (2) secs" /></p></li>
<li><p>To make it a bit more impressive, you could make the monsters <strong>mouth open</strong> and <strong>close</strong> whilst it is talking. To do this, edit the sprite that contains the mouth - create a new <code class="blockpurple">costume</code> that has a closed mouth. By switching between the two, you can animate the mouth opening and closing.</p>
<p><img src="342bfa69a8a0f739acccb728ba157d9e94a5df38.png" alt="repeat (8)
    wait (0.1) secs
    switch costume to [mouthClosed v]
    wait (0.1) secs
    switch costume to [mouthOpen v]
end" /></p></li>
<li><p>To hook the two up, have the block that does the <code class="blockpurple">say</code> broadcast a message that the other block can react to.</p>
<p><img src="061824abb7cdad4a5e62f3d470f992b0fac0cfa6.png" alt="when [space v] key pressed
    broadcast [talk v]
    say [Hello!] for (2) secs

when I receive [talk v]
    repeat (8)
        wait (0.1) secs
        switch costume to [mouthClosed v]
        wait (0.1) secs
        switch costume to [mouthOpen v]
    end" /></p></li>
<li><p>To make this a bit more flexible, use a variable to control the <code class="blockorange">talkTime</code> the monster says something for, and also to control how many times the animation loop is repeated.</p>
<p><img src="f7a6159a5ff4883238bb8961a23fe6fa12352281.png" alt="when [space v] key pressed
    set [talkTime v] to (2)
    broadcast [talk v ]
    say [Hello!] for (talkTime) secs

when [a v] key pressed
    set [talkTime v] to (4)
    broadcast [talk v]
    say [Something a bit longer] for (talkTime) secs

when I receive [talk v]
    repeat ((talkTime) * (4))
        wait (0.1) secs
        switch costume to [mouthClosed v]
        wait (0.1) secs
        switch costume to [mouthOpen v]
    end" /></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(Notice how we multiply <code>talkTime</code> by 4 to make sure the loop repeats enough times?)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can also make your monster speak using sound by using one of the sound blocks. Just be sure to import the sounds first in the sounds tab.</p>
<p><img src="22fede61f0444e7056399a43b9be67e4d363f51f.png" alt="when I receive [talking v]
    play sound [Screech v]" /></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Why not try adding sounds to other events, you could use a spooky hovering sound for a ghost drifting around the screen!</p>
<p>If you have a microphone on your computer you can even record your own sounds, surprise your classmates by recording a loud monster ROOOAAAAARRRRR!!!</p>
